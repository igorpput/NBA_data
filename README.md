At the point when I set this up, all of the data is taken from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores

It is an awesome source, I really recommend checking out if the data is not updated anymore, but I will try to automate it.
Their way of handling it is awesome, I just found it easier to access it all in here, that's all.

If it somehow violates any rights, please let me know and contact me directly.
